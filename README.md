## About
The goal for this project was to make a simple reactive web page based to show off my music hardware, and have a contact page.

## Code
This was coded with CSS, HTML and uses an import from Font Awesome. Two CSS files were created one for the style of the page and another for styles that could be used across multiple pages or sites. 

## Access
This page is hosted on Netlify and can be seen by clicking this link:

## Future Plans
Future plans are to include a modal when a user clicks on one of the instrument images, maybe link in with Soundcloud or similar music hosting service and to implement the contact me function.
