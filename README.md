## About
The goal for this project was to make a simple reactive web page based to show off my music hardware, and have a contact page.

## Code
This was coded with CSS, HTML and uses a one import from Font Awesome

## Access
This page is hosted on Netlify and can be seen by clicking this link:  

## Future Plans
Future plans are to include a modal when a user clicks on one of the instrument images, and maybe link in with Soundcloud or similar music hosting service.
